## Motivation

Assume you are working on a Todo app.
![homer's Todo List](https://rorsch-1256426089.file.myqcloud.com/public/202301302120989.webp)
This app uses an HTTP API to retrieve all of the to-do items. You and your back-end colleagues agree on a data type for to-doÔºö

```typescript
type Todo = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  /**
   * 0 means active, 1 means completed
   */
  status: 0 | 1;
};
```

Also, this app contain a select component for filtering out active/completed items, and you could build the following data structure to represent all of the possible options:

```typescript
const statusFilterOptions = [
  {
    value: 0,
    label: "active",
  },
  {
    value: 1,
    label: "completed",
  },
];
```

You may define a type for this data structure to avoid a coworker or yourself from accidentally outputting a bug while refactoring this code laterÔºö

```typescript
type Option = {
  value: Todo["status"];
  label: string;
};

const statusFilterOptions: Option[] = [
  {
    value: 0,
    label: "active",
  },
  {
    value: 1,
    label: "completed",
  },
];
```

In general, if your team is simply using¬†Typescript, this is sufficient. However, if we want to be more specific about the type¬†of `statusFilterOptions`,¬†we may go much farther here. The following examples of `statusFilterOptions`, while satisfying the `Option` type, will cause bugs in the select component used to **filter out incomplete/completed items** in a production environment:

```typescript
// some value in options
const statusFilterOptions: Option[] = [
  {
    value: 1,
    label: "active",
  },
  {
    value: 1,
    label: "completed",
  },
];

// missing one option
const statusFilterOptions: Option[] = [
  {
    value: 1,
    label: "active",
  },
];

// option is overwritten by one
const statusFilterOptions: Option[] = [
  {
    value: 0,
    label: "active",
  },
  {
    value: 1,
    label: "completed",
  },
  {
    value: 2,
    label: "completed",
  },
];
```

Not only to eliminate the above bug cases, but consider a real-world business scenario in which the product may change frequently, and the status of todo may become 0, 1 and 2 later on. To prevent the situation where only the `Todo` type is modified and the filter options are not modified at the same time, we can write a type that can be widely used in such scenarios.

## Coding

Consider our type's input and output first. We expect the input type to be a set like `0 | 1` or `male | female`, and the expected output type should be an array containing all the elements of the set precisely, one cannot be more, one cannot be less üôÖ‚ôÄÔ∏è, and the order of the array elements is adjustable. It is easy to conclude that what we need is a type that converts `union` to `set`. The following is the `UnionToSet` code.

```typescript
type UnionToSet<
  U extends string | number | symbol,
  R extends (string | number | symbol)[] = []
> = {
  [S in U]: Exclude<U, S> extends never
    ? [...R, S]
    : UnionToSet<Exclude<U, S>, [...R, S]>;
}[U];
```

The above code implements the conversion by recursively traversing U. The three following points should be noticed at ‚ö†Ô∏èÔºö

- **Uses the heavyweight features provided by TypeScript version 4.0: [Variadic Tuple Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-0.html#variadic-tuple-types)**„ÄÇTherefore, it can only be used in TypeScript 4.0 and above.
- **Based on recursion**. Although [ TypeScript 4.5 is optimized for tail recursion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-5.html#tail-recursion-elimination-on-conditional-types)ÔºåAlthough [TypeScript 4.5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-5.html#tail-recursion-elimination-on-conditional-types) is optimized for tail recursion, the `UnionToSet` cannot be converted to tail recursion mode, so please do not use it when the collection is too large.
- **JavaScript Object key type limitation**. Because of the JavaScript object key limitation, TypeScript is limited to the type of U in '[S in U]' must inherit from'string | numebr | symbol', therefore a union such as 'true | false' cannot utilize this type. Of course, because the Boolean type has only two values, Even if you make a typo on True or False, your IDE will tell you, so it is not essential to restrict the type precisely.

Here we can do a small optimization, in the above code, U inherits from `string | number`, R inherits from `string | number`, so we can abstract this type and mask U and R to the userÔºö

```typescript
type UnionToSetHelper<
  T extends keyof any,
  U extends T = T,
  R extends T[] = []
> = {
  [S in U]: Exclude<U, S> extends never
    ? [...R, S]
    : UnionToSetHelper<T, Exclude<U, S>, [...R, S]>;
}[U];

export type UnionToSet<T extends keyof any> = UnionToSetHelper<T>;
```

The following are examples of 'UnionToSet' test cases:

```typescript
const a: UnionToSet<0 | 1> = [0, 1]; // ‚úÖ
const a: UnionToSet<0 | 1> = [1, 0]; // ‚úÖ
const b: UnionToSet<0 | 1> = [0, 1, 2]; // ‚ùé
const c: UnionToSet<0 | 1> = [0]; // ‚ùé
const d: UnionToSet<0 | 1> = [1, 1]; // ‚ùé
```

Based on the `UnionToSet` type we built, we can simply code¬†a `Options` type that is strongly associated with real-world business:Ôºö

```typescript
type Option<T extends keyof any> = {
  value: T;
  label: string;
};

type OptionsHelper<
  T extends keyof any,
  U extends T = T,
  R extends Option<T>[] = []
> = {
  [S in U]: Exclude<U, S> extends never
    ? [...R, Option<S>]
    : OptionsHelper<T, Exclude<U, S>, [...R, Option<S>]>;
}[U];

type Options<T extends keyof any> = OptionsHelper<T>;
```

The following is the Todo demo in this article; you may attempt to edit the 'Todo' type in'src/App.tsx' after forking.

## Bonus

This article concentrates on the situation of 'union to set', and it's logical to question if 'union' can be converted to 'tuple'(sorted set).
You can jump to this [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13298) to see what people are talking about. [This question](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/main/questions/00730-hard-union-to-tuple/README.md)¬†is also available in [type-challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges).

## In the end

I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions‚ù§Ô∏è.
